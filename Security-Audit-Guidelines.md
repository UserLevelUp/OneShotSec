# Security Audit Guidelines - One-Shot Password Framework
**Status: Work in Progress**

## Overview
These guidelines will establish security standards for provider certification within the One-Shot Password ecosystem.

## Core Security Areas (Ideas to Develop)

### 1. Cryptographic Standards
**Starting Points**:
- Minimum key lengths (RSA 4096, ECC P-384)
- Approved algorithms (AES-256-GCM, SHA-384)
- Key rotation policies (30-90 days)
- Certificate management requirements

### 2. Infrastructure Security (Initial Requirements)
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, DDoS protection
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions, MFA for admins
- **Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection

### 3. Compliance Frameworks (To Consider)
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- ISO 27001/27002 alignment
- GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Industry-specific standards (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

### 4. Audit Checklist (Draft Items)
- [ ] Penetration testing (quarterly)
- [ ] Code security review (continuous)
- [ ] Dependency scanning (daily)
- [ ] Infrastructure hardening verification
- [ ] Incident response plan testing
- [ ] Data handling procedures audit

### 5. Provider Certification Levels (Concept)
Bronze: Basic security requirements Silver: Enhanced security + compliance Gold: Enterprise-grade + advanced features Platinum: Military-grade + custom solutions


## Audit Process (Ideas to Explore)
1. Self-assessment questionnaire
2. Technical vulnerability assessment
3. Third-party security review
4. Continuous monitoring requirements
5. Annual recertification

## Next Steps
- Develop detailed audit criteria
- Create automated testing tools
- Establish certification authority
- Define remediation timelines
